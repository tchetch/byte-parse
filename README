byte-parse
----------

Parse byte separated value. Useful to create a csv parser, a tsv parser or 
anything that need to parse some file like

  Value [0x??] Value [0x??] Value [0x??] Value [0x!!] 
  Value [0x??] Value [0x??] Value [0x??] Value [0x!!] 
  Value [0x??] Value [0x??] Value [0x??] Value [0x!!] 
  Value [0x??] Value [0x??] Value [0x??] Value [0x!!]

It doesn't necessary copy value into memory if you tell it not to do. It'll
only record position in file and later load as soon as you ask it, allowing
to parse any sized file.

File format can be anything, you just need to tell it which byte has which
meaning before running it.
